Vox-Codei-codingame
===================

The solution I submited for the Vox Codei codingame challenge.

##CodinGames

CodinGames is a web site which proposes to solve an algorithmic problem with a limited amount of time. It exposes a online code editor and runs the solution script on its machines to validate a test set. At the end, a score is computed depanding on the validated tests and the time spend on the code.

##The challenge

This time, the challenge was about a turn based game. 

It is no longer accessible. But I guess it will be soon, as training challenge.

##My Solution

It passes 100% of the tests ! And I got a nice ranking ! [rank page](http://www.codingame.com/ranking/vox-codei/378743e67254ca00eeb3eb404a039437f806dd)

The run.html mocks the functions exposed by the codingames environnement and allows to run the solution localy ( which allows to inspect the code during execution with a devtool ).
